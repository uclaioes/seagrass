      <h1>Who We Are</h1>
      <p>We are the 2019-2020 UCLA Ocean Undergraduate Research Team. With the help of the Bay Foundation and UCLA's Institute of the Environment and Sustainability, we will continue researching how to save our oceans and Santa Monica coastal communities from climate change!</p>

      <img src="img/good_edited.jpg" alt="">

      <h2>Our Goals</h2>
      <p>By building upon years of research provided by past practicum teams, as well as affiliates of The Bay Foundation, our team hopes to fill knowledge gaps that hamper the understanding of seagrass habitats in the Santa Monica Bay (SMB). By utilizing tools at our disposal, such as Underwater Remotely Operated Vehicles (UROVs) and a variety of other instruments we hope to understand the biochemical and spatial profiles of seagrass meadows along the shores of Catalina Island. Using a variety of methods such as sonar and field sampling we hope to be able to bolster geographic maps of the seagrass meadows themselves, as well as better understand how they may change the chemistry of the ocean around them in the face of rising ocean acidification. With time, these profiles should help the Bay Foundation better understand the seagrass meadows of the SMB and inform future restoration plans.</p>
